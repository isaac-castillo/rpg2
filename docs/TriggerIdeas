A Behavior is a pair of Trigger and Actions



Certain behaviors:


    When a unit steps on a tile, it teleports to another tile.
        Trigger:
            onEnter({some tile); //attaches to the tile
            When a unit enters a tile, the physics system it checks that this trigger is active, and calls the action on the enterring unit. 
        Action:
            TeleportTo({some location}); 
    When the player talks to an NPC (Interaction), the NPC looks at the player.
        Trigger:
            onTalkTo({some entity})
            When the player interacts with an NPC, the physics system checks that a trigger exists, and calls the action on the NPC.             
        Action:
            LookAt(player, {some entity})
    When a tile is stepped on by a unit, it "activates", and when it is not stepped on, it deactivates.
        Trigger:
            onEnter({some tile})
            When a unit enters the tile, the physics system checks that this trigger is active, and activates.
        Action:
            activate({some thing})


BaseTriggers:

    
    Callback Trigger:
        TileTriggerManager:
           
        setTrigger(Tile, Action, [onEnter, onExit, onTopOf]);        
        onEnter() {
            return Action; 
        }
        onExit() {
            
        }
        
    EntityTriggerManager:
            setTrigger(Entity, Action, [onInteract, onStopInteract, onInteracting]);

    
   
    SceneTriggerManager:

        addTrigger(PollableTrigger, Action)
